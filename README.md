Naan Mudhalvan semester_6 Project : Train and test CNN model using yelp review dataset for sentiment analysis

# Project Overview:
This project aims to leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to build a binary text classification model that automatically classifies Yelp reviews into two categories: positive and negative. By utilizing advanced NLP techniques and deep learning, we seek to create a model that not only improves accuracy over traditional methods but also offers insights into the features driving sentiment in customer reviews.

# Problem Statement:
In the vast sea of online reviews, distinguishing between positive and negative feedback is crucial for businesses to understand customer sentiment and improve services. Manual review classification is time-consuming and prone to errors. How can we automate the process of categorizing Yelp reviews into positive or negative sentiment accurately and efficiently?

# About the dataset:
The Yelp reviews polarity dataset is constructed by considering stars 1 and 2 negative, and 3 and 4 positive. For each polarity 280,000 training samples and 19,000 testing samples are take randomly. In total there are 560,000 trainig samples and 38,000 testing samples. Negative polarity is class 1, and positive class 2.
